# PrepMates - Collaborative Coding and Job Application Management Platform

## Project Overview
PrepMates is a web application designed to help students collaboratively prepare for coding interviews and efficiently manage job applications. The platform facilitates a seamless user experience where students can share coding resources, engage in group discussions, and track their job application progress. Built with real-time features for collaboration, this platform aims to be the go-to tool for students preparing for coding interviews.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Primary User Dashboard:** A central hub where users can manage coding questions and job postings, create and join groups, save questions, and track job applications.
- **Real-Time Features:** Real-time group chats and discussion forums for collaborative problem-solving, powered by WebSockets.
- **Browser Extensions:** Extensions developed for saving coding questions and job postings, with personalized notes for enhanced user organization.
- **Deployment:** Deployed using Docker for containerization on AWS EC2 with the frontend hosted on Vercel to ensure scalability and reliability.
- **Future Enhancements:** The application will include a reminder system for job postings, sharing features for job postings, and uploading study resources for collaborative learning.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2, Docker, Vercel
